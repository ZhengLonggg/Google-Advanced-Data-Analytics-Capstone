# Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics-Capstone
Project overview: <br>
This capstone project analyses HR data using Python to identify key factors of employee attrition and provide recommendations for improving employee retention. Using machine learning techniques, I built predictive models to determine which factors contribute most to attrition. <br> <br>

This capstone project utilises data from Kaggle, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction/discussion/454737)
<br><br>
General sequence of steps: <br> 
• Data cleaning and exploration <br>
→ Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers. <br>
- Performed encoding for categorical variables <br>
• Model Building <br>
- Trained two models (Decision Tree and XGBoost) <br>
- Used grid search for hyperparameter tuning <br>
- Evaluated models using confusion matrices and classification report <br>
• Findings <br>
- Analysed feature importance <br>
• Business recommendations <br>
- Translated model findings into actionable HR strategies
