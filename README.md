# Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics-Capstone
Project overview: <br>
This capstone project analyses HR data using Python to identify key factors of employee attrition and provide recommendations for improving employee retention. Using machine learning techniques, I built predictive models to determine which factors contribute most to attrition. <br> <br>

This capstone project utilises data from Kaggle, which is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction/data)
<br><br>
General sequence of steps: <br> 
1) Data cleaning and exploration <br>
→ Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers. <br>
→ Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and derived insights. <br>
→ Performed encoding for categorical variables. <br> <br>
2) Model Building <br>
→ Trained two models (Decision Tree and XGBoost). <br>
→ Used grid search for hyperparameter tuning. <br>
→ Evaluated models using confusion matrices and classification reports. <br> <br>
3) Findings <br>
→ Used the best-performing model to analyse feature importance. <br> <br>
4) Business recommendations. <br>
→ Translated model findings into actionable HR strategies.
